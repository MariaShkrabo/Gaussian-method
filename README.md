# Selection of the number of unknowns in the SLE (system of linear equations);
# Formation and change of the SLE template depending on the selected value of the number of unknowns;
# Filling in the template manually;
# Filling the template automatically with random values by contacting the server;
# Cleaning the template;
# Viewing the results of calculations;
# Writing data to Word;
# Writing data to Excel;
# Opening the help system.
Dialogue with the user is supported using the main and drop-down menus, toolbars, buttons and other interface elements.
